# spectroCustom
A customized spectrogram of recordings

This is a simple encapsulation of Joshua Flickinger's amazing work available here : https://rug.mnhn.fr/seewave/spec.html

The script takes a Wave R object (create by readWave function) and gives a nice and contrasted spectrogram of your recording. Please be aware that long and high-frequency recordings can take a lot of time to show up.
